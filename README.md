# QMK Layout ‚Äì Keychron K2 HE (ANSI RGB)

This repo contains my custom QMK keymap (`mylayout`) for the **Keychron K2 HE** with Hall Effect switches and an ANSI RGB layout.  
Built on Keychron‚Äôs `hall_effect_playground` branch of QMK firmware.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions (macOS)

### 1. Install QMK CLI
```bash
brew install qmk/qmk/qmk
```

### 2. Clone the Correct Firmware Branch
```bash
git clone -b hall_effect_playground https://github.com/Keychron/qmk_firmware.git ~/qmk_firmware
qmk setup -H ~/qmk_firmware
```
This sets `~/qmk_firmware` as your QMK home directory.

### 3. (Optional but Recommended) Install QMK Toolbox
For easier firmware flashing:
```bash
brew install --cask qmk-toolbox
```

---

## üíª Compiling the Firmware

Make sure you're in the QMK firmware root:
```bash
cd ~/qmk_firmware
```

(Optional) Update submodules:
```bash
qmk pull
# or
git submodule update --init
```

Then compile the firmware using your custom keymap:
```bash
qmk compile -kb keychron/k2_he/ansi_rgb -km mylayout
```

## üß† Notes

- This layout is in `keyboards/keychron/k2_he/ansi_rgb/keymaps/mylayout/`.
- You can flash the compiled `.bin` using QMK Toolbox.

## üì¶ Repo Purpose

This repo only includes the keymap folder (`mylayout`) ‚Äî not the full QMK firmware.  
You‚Äôll still need to clone the full firmware from Keychron to compile it.
